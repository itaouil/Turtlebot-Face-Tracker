# **Turtlebot-Face-Tracker**

## **Aim**

The following is a personal project with the Turtlebot robot, which would be easily transferable across the ROS platform. The aim of the task it to make the Turtlebot track a face which recognised through the image input, which in this case could be the built-in kinnect or the connected laptop's camera.

## **Technologies**

The technologies used for the project consists in the ROS platform and its many packages and OpenCV for the face detection process. The language of choice for the project is Python, and I hope to push a C++ version once the Python section is completed.

## **Diagram and small explanation**

The following is a high-level schematic that shows how are the building blocks of the project connected:
